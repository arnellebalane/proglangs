proglangs
=========

Different modules that I will need for our programming languages class.

##### Included Modules

- Equation Tokenizer
- Equation Recognizer
- Infix-to-Postfix Converter
- Postfix Calculator
- Code Tokenizer

##### How to run module demos

The demos in this project are built on node-webkit (nw), so first of all you have to install node-webkit (nw). Installation is different between operating systems, so find the right one for you from [github](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) or from their [official website](http://nwjs.io/).

After installing node-webkit, you will get a new terminal command called `nw`. Go inside the demo directory you want to view (e.g. `postfix-calculator/demo/`) and then run:

```
$ nw .
```

This will open up the demo window for that module.
